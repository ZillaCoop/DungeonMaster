DungeonMaster is an application where you can create, build and level up your characters.  
There are four classes to choose from: Barbarian, Wizard, Swashbuckler and an Archer.  
As you progress and level up, you can equip weapons and armor to boost your attributes.

The application contains a test suite named "DungeonMaster.Tests".
